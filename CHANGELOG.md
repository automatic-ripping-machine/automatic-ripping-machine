# Changelog


## Current pre-release v2.5.0
  - Only one large item for this version.

    Now added the possibility for users to use [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) as their metadata provider, this only works for movies at the moment. 
    In time this will have the same functionality as OMDB (movies and tv shows)
    The idea driving this is that users should be able to choose their metadata provider.
    I also think this is safer route in the long term, its better to have multiple options than only focus on one provider.
    
    - Added method to let users send/submit their correctly identified movies to a new crc64 API (an api key required)
    - Added check for crc64 from remote database
  
  - **New Feature: Disc Label-Based TV Series Folder Naming** (opt-in)
    - Added `USE_DISC_LABEL_FOR_TV` configuration option for deterministic TV series folder naming
    - When enabled, ARM parses disc labels for season/disc identifiers (e.g., S1D1, S01D02, Season1Disc1)
    - Creates folders like "Breaking_Bad_S1D1" instead of "Breaking Bad (2008)" with timestamps
    - Supports 15+ common disc label formats with intelligent parsing and normalization
    - Falls back to standard naming if parsing fails (backward compatible)
    - See [TV Series Organization](arm_wiki/Using-Disc-Label-for-TV-Series.md) for full documentation
  
  - **New Feature: TV Series Folder Grouping** (opt-in)
    - Added `GROUP_TV_DISCS_UNDER_SERIES` configuration option to organize multi-disc series
    - When enabled, creates parent series folder containing all season/disc subfolders
    - Structure: `{Series Title (Year)}/{Breaking_Bad_S1D1, Breaking_Bad_S1D2, etc.}`
    - Works independently or in combination with `USE_DISC_LABEL_FOR_TV`
    - Recommended for organized media server libraries with predictable hierarchy
    - Both features use per-job database snapshots ensuring configuration consistency

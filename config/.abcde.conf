# Choose whether you want to use "cddb", "musicbrainz" and/or
# "cdtext". Default is "musicbrainz", but all can be specified in a
# comma delimited list to be tried sequentially. All the results will
# be displayed ready for user choice.

# Right now 5 is latin1 output and 6 is UTF8 encoding.
#CDDBPROTO=6

# The CDDB protocol requires hello information, including a valid username
# and hostname. If you feel paranoid about giving away such info, edit this
# line - the format is username@hostname.
#HELLOINFO="`whoami`@`hostname`"

# This controls the email address CDDB changes are submitted to.

# If NOSUBMIT is set to y, then abcde will never prompt asking if you
# wish to submit your edited cddb file.
#NOSUBMIT=n

# If NOCDDBQUERY is set to y, then abcde will never even try to access
# the CDDB server; running abcde will automatically drop you into a
# blank cddb file to edit at your leisure.  This is the same as the
# -n option.  NOCDDBQUERY=y implies NOSUBMIT=y.
#NOCDDBQUERY=n

# Select here if you want to use the locally stored CDDB entries.
# This is useful if you do a lot of editing to those CDDB entries.
# Also, other tools like Grip store CDDB entries under $HOME/.cddb,
# so they can be reused when ripping CDs. (If this is set to "y" make

# 3. Delete a grab bag of characters which variously Windows and Linux do not permit

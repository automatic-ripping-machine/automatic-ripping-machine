# Workaround for Track 99
# A DRM scheme used on some DVDs which creates fake titles which confuses Handbrake.
# When set to "false" affected DVDs will be passed to MakeMKV for ripping, but this can crash or hang
# Setting this to true will eject the disc and log only to the system logging
PREVENT_99: true

# Distinguish UDF video discs from UDF data discs.  Requires mounting disc so adds a few seconds to the identify script.
ARM_CHECK_UDF: true

# Umask for created files (in RAW_PATH, TRANSCODE_PATH, and COMPLETED_PATH).

# This will produce the highest quality videos (and use the most storage)
# Note: RIPMETHOD must be set to "mkv" for this feature to work
# Note: The largest file will be considered to be the "main feature" but there are cases when this is not true
# to avoid losing a desired track, use this feature with an EXTRAS_SUB value that is not "None"
SKIP_TRANSCODE: false

# Video type identification.  Options are "auto", "series", "movie".
# If "auto" then ARM will get the video type when querying the movie webservice.  This is default.

# Use disc label for TV series output folder naming (opt-in feature)
# When enabled, ARM will parse the disc label for season/disc identifiers (e.g., S1D1, S01D02)
# and create folders like "Breaking_Bad_S1D1" instead of "Breaking Bad (2008)"
# The series name comes from the lookup service or manual title, ensuring consistency
# If parsing fails, ARM falls back to the standard naming (series name + timestamp)
# Default: false (disabled for backward compatibility)

# Batch rename naming style for TV series folders
# Controls the character used to separate words in folder names when using batch rename

# Can be overridden per-job in the batch rename UI
# Default: "underscore"
BATCH_RENAME_NAMING_STYLE: "underscore"

# Batch rename zero-padding for disc identifiers
# When enabled, disc identifiers use zero-padded numbers (S01D01 instead of S1D1)
# Can be overridden per-job in the batch rename UI

# Batch rename consolidation default
# When enabled, batch rename will default to consolidating discs under series parent folder
# Can be overridden per-job in the batch rename UI
# Default: false
BATCH_RENAME_CONSOLIDATE_DEFAULT: false
# Group TV series discs under a parent series folder (opt-in feature)
# When enabled, ARM will organize multiple disc folders under a single series parent folder
# Structure: {COMPLETED_PATH}/tv/{Series Title (Year)}/{Breaking_Bad_S1D1, Breaking_Bad_S1D2, etc.}
# Example with both features enabled:
#   - Parent folder: "Breaking Bad (2008)"
#   - Disc folders: "Breaking_Bad_S1D1", "Breaking_Bad_S1D2", "Breaking_Bad_S2D1"
# When USE_DISC_LABEL_FOR_TV is disabled, disc folders will still be grouped but named with timestamps
# This feature works best when combined with USE_DISC_LABEL_FOR_TV for predictable folder names
# Default: false (disabled for backward compatibility)
GROUP_TV_DISCS_UNDER_SERIES: false

## MakeMKV Parameters ##
########################

# Storage for a purchased key the user may have paid for. Populating will prevent the beta key updater from running.
MAKEMKV_PERMA_KEY: ""

# Method of MakeMKV to use for Blu-ray discs
# Options are "mkv", "backup", or "backup_dvd".
# backup decrypts the dvd and then copies it to the hard drive.
# This allows HandBrake to apply some of its analytical abilities such as the main-feature identification.
# This method seems to offer success on Blu-ray discs that fail in "mkv" mode.
# *** NOTE: MakeMKV only supports the backup or backup_dvd method on BluRay discs.
# backup_dvd forces arm to extract the dvd with MakeMKV prior to the Handbrake step
RIPMETHOD: "mkv"
RIPMETHOD_DVD: "PLACEHOLDER"
RIPMETHOD_BR: "PLACEHOLDER"

# MakeMKV Arguments
# MakeMKV Profile used for controlling Audio Track Selection.
# This is the default profile MakeMKV uses for Audio track selection. Updating this file or changing it is considered
# to be advanced usage of MakeMKV. But this will allow users to alternatively tell makemkv to select HD audio tracks and etc.
# MKV_ARGS: "--profile=/opt/arm/default.mmcp.xml"

# files.  
# This will require libdvdcss2 be installed.
# NOTE: For the most part, HandBrake correctly identifies the main feature on movie DVD's, although it is not perfect. 
# However, it does not handle tv shows well at all.  This setting is only used when the video is identified as a movie.

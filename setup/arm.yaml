## MakeMKV Parameters ##
########################

# Storage for a purchased key the user may have paid for. Populating will prevent the beta key updater from running.
MAKEMKV_PERMA_KEY: ""

# Method of MakeMKV to use for Blu-ray discs
# Options are "mkv", "backup", or "backup_dvd".
# backup decrypts the dvd and then copies it to the hard drive.
# This allows HandBrake to apply some of its analytical abilities such as the main-feature identification.
# This method seems to offer success on Blu-ray discs that fail in "mkv" mode.
# *** NOTE: MakeMKV only supports the backup or backup_dvd method on BluRay discs.
# backup_dvd forces arm to extract the dvd with MakeMKV prior to the Handbrake step
RIPMETHOD: "mkv"
RIPMETHOD_DVD: "PLACEHOLDER"
RIPMETHOD_BR: "PLACEHOLDER"

# MakeMKV Arguments
# MakeMKV Profile used for controlling Audio Track Selection.
# This is the default profile MakeMKV uses for Audio track selection. Updating this file or changing it is considered
# to be advanced usage of MakeMKV. But this will allow users to alternatively tell makemkv to select HD audio tracks and etc.
# MKV_ARGS: "--profile=/opt/arm/default.mmcp.xml"
# MKV_ARGS: "--debug=-stdout"  # this will enable more detailed logging

# Have HandBrake transcode the main feature only.  BluRay discs must have RIPMETHOD="backup" for this to work.
# If MAINFEATURE is true, blurays will be backed up to the HD and then HandBrake will go to work on the backed up
# files.
# This will require libdvdcss2 be installed.
# NOTE: For the most part, HandBrake correctly identifies the main feature on movie DVD's, although it is not perfect.
# However, it does not handle tv shows well at all.  This setting is only used when the video is identified as a movie.
